# F-Suite
F-Suite is an IoT based system that aims to contribute towards the Smart
Agriculture by providing the farmer with results of efficient analysis and
prediction, done using the processing of real time data. Thereby, enabling and
assisting the farmers to implement suitable methodologies contributing towards
good quality production as well as maximising the yield, hence benefitting from
it. This system will depend upon the sensor data gathered using the IoT
infrastructure, along with the use of accurate prediction algorithms, the results
of which are communicated to the farmers using an appropriate user interface
the system would consist of. Analysis and extraction from collected data would
take place in the server of the system.
The main focus of the idea is to develop a complete functional suite for farmer
to facilitate smart and precision farming. This suite will encompass of effective
prediction and analysis on real time data collected from various appropriate
sources so as to do the mapping of demand and supply between different parts
of the nation; thereby maximising farmers profit. This suite comprises of
methodologies to offer customized crop suggestions to farmers based on
appropriate parameters. This suite will be beneficial for the farmers worldwide
since it offers these services through a mobile application that operates in native
language.
